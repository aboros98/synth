In this sentence, they are used incorrectly to separate phrases or clauses that are not independent.\n2. **Lack of parallel structure**: The items in the list \"milk, and eggs badly\" are not parallel in structure. \"Badly\" is an adverb that doesn't belong with the nouns \"milk\" and \"eggs\".\n3. **Excessive use of punctuation**: The sentence has too many punctuation marks, which makes it hard to read and understand.\n4. **Inconsistent verb tense**: The sentence switches between past perfect (\"had left\") and simple past (\"realized\", \"went\") verb tenses.\n\nHere's the corrected sentence:\n\n\"After walking to the store, I realized I had left my wallet at home.
